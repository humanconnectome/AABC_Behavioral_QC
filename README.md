# AABC_Behavioral_QC
Behavioral Datatype QC, Inventory, and Snapshot functions

This bare bones repo, when run weekly by hand, produces QC flags as outlined here: https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/display/CCFPUB/AABC+Behavioral+Data+Types+and+QC

Eventually these flags will be turned into Jira tickets and automated.  Hopefully the urgency of that task will remain low.
